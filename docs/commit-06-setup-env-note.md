Summary: Clarify environment variable expectations in SETUP.md

This note lists the minimal environment variables expected when
running locally (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`).

Files touched: SETUP.md (env variable list suggestion)

Rationale: reduce initial setup confusion for contributors.
