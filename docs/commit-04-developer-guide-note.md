Summary: Small developer guide clarifying branch workflow

This note recommends a short paragraph in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
about using feature branches and keeping `dev` rebased on `main`.

Files touched: DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md (suggested workflow note)

Rationale: reduce merge friction and onboarding friction.
